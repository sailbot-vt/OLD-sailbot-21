This  file gives an example of how the CV functions can be used

There is a function named getCameraNumbers() in test_cameras.py that will tell you which cameras to use when creating 
your distance calculator.
These numbers change for different computers, so I am not sure if they will stay as (2,3) when instantiating a 
distance calculator.
