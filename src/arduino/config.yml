# Ports must have their function in all caps.
# All ports must include
#   port_name -- The path of the port
#   port_type -- The method of communication, e.g. SERIAL, USB
#
# Port types in this module:
#   - SERIAL
#
# SERIAL:
#   Serial pins must specify 
#   port_name: which can be found through
#       'ls /dev/tty*' or 'ls /dev/serial/by-id'
#   port_type: Type of port used
#   frequency: rate that airmar sends data to port in seconds.
#   encoding: Type of encoding to use to convert byte data.
#   sentence_id: List of mea0183 sentence types, i.e., $GPGGA -> "GGA"
#   baudrate: standard - 4800, or 38400 (though most nmea instruments
#       cannot operate at 38400)
#   timeout: time rest for port.
# 
# Pins must have their function in all caps.
# All pins must include
#   pin_name -- The BBB name of the pin, e.g. "P0_0"
#   pin_type -- The method for reading input from the pin, e.g. ADC
#
# Pin types in this module:
#   - UART
#
# UART:
#  UART pins must specify channel. One of "UART1", "UART2", "UART4" OR "UART5"
