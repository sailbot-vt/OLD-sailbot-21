# Pins must have their function in all caps.
# All pins must include
#   pin_name -- The BBB name of the pin, e.g. "P0_0"
#   pin_type -- The method for reading input from the pin, e.g. ADC
#
# Pin types in this module:
#   - ADC
#   - GPIO
#
# ADC:
#   ADC pins must have io_type specified as either IN or OUT.
#
# GPIO:
#   GPIO pins must specify min_v, default_v, and max_v, the minimum, default, and
#   maximum voltages, respectively.
