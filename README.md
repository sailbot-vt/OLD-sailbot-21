### Architecture

The software design document detailing the system architecture can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JsAZn4CWerVZ45uQ7lLZehaZM9W0XL9Jg_lDHFKbvsM/edit?usp=sharing).

### Installation Instructions

1. Ensure that you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and a version of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your computer by running `git --version` and `docker --version`. If either command does not give you a version number, you do not have the respective software.

2. Move to the directory where you would like to store your local copy of the code, and clone the repository by running `git clone git@github.com:vt-sailbot/sailbot-20.git`.

3. There is no longer a distinct initialization step. Initialization will occur upon first building an image through the commands `make test`, `make run` or `make run_cli`. Note: the first time that you run these commands on your machine, the initialization will take 5 minutes. After that first initialization, if there are no changes to the initialization instructions for the container, building the new docker image will be much faster.

### Development Instructions

A developmental environment is included as a docker image. We reccommend using this docker container rather than a typical python virtual environment, so our development environment remains consistent throughout the team. 

To use a development image, either build the dev-base image by running: `make build_dev_base`. By default, the base image will be debian-stretch. To use a different debian version, replace `{VERSION}` in 

`docker build -t sailbotvt/sailbot-20:sailbot-development-base --build-arg FLAVOR={VERSION} -f Dockerfile.base_dev .` 

with the preferred version and run that command. The final image can be built and ran through the command `make dev`. This will allow you to enter a debian environment with python3 and our developmental packages installed. The first time you make the base image and the development image, the initialization will take 10-15 minutes. After that first initialization, if there are no changes to the base container, compiling and building the source on the development container will be much faster. Note, this environment is not production ready, and code must be tested through `make test`. 

The requirement files must be updated before running anything. `requirements.tests.txt`, `requirements.prod.txt`, and `requirements.dev.txt` must be appended with any newly added python packages at the bottom half of the files. The first half of the mentioned files should stay consistent with `requirements.base.txt`. Note, some packages may build on dev (x86/x64), but not in production (ARM). In this case, the package needs to be compiled in `Dockerfile.base` and built using `make build_base`. The new base image should be pushed to Dockerhub. **WARNING**, building a new base takes **~10 hours** (The culprit is compiling scipy's binaries to ARM). The preferred solution is to look for an alternative.

### Testing Instructions

Any code pushed to this repository will automatically be subject to all existing test methods as well as any newly added tests.

To run tests locally before pushing, run `make test` on macOS or Linux, or run each command under `test` in `Makefile` separately on Windows. Running `make test` first builds a production-ready docker container with updated source files. Upon build completion, unit tests are ran.

Test coverage should be as complete as is practical â€“ for most classes, it should be 90% to 100%. Recall that robustness is our first design requirement.

### Deployment Instructions

There are two options to deploy to the Beaglebone Black. For both ensure that the beaglebone is connected and run `make beag_init`, then `ssh debian@beaglebone.local`, and run `sudo make init` to setup the Beaglebone. If on Windows, inspect the `beag_init` commands to transfer the appropriate files to the Beaglebone, and use an ssh client to connect.

#### Automated Deployment

Upon a successful pull request with master, a new Docker image will be built and pushed to the central Dockerhub. Once that occurs, running `make run` on the Beaglebone will (attempt to) pull that image and run it. Optionally, to access the command line interface, the command `make run-cli` can be used instead. This is the preferred option for stable, long-term deployment.

#### Local Deployment

To use this command, you will need to set `experimental=True` in your [docker-daemon configurations](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/). By running `make build_prod_tar`, a local docker image built for the Beaglebone is created and compressed on your local machine then finally sent to the beaglebone, if on Linux or macOS. For windows, the newly created `beaglebone-img.tar.gz` tarbell needs to be transfered via a file transfer program. Please note, the first time that this command is run after each change to initialization instructions will take 15-30 minutes. Then, with the Beaglebone either physically connected to your machine (via USB or Ethernet) or on the same network as your machine, you can sync the Docker image tarball to Beaglebone using rsync, scp, etc. Then, on the Beaglebone, use the command `make load` and then use `make run` or `make run-cli`.
